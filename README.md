# Marley

A basic gravity simulation built using python and pygame.

## Prerequisites

- **Python**: Ensure you have Python installed. If not, you can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **pygame**: This game requires pygame version 2.5.0.

After you clone this repo and install the prerequisites you can run main.py and try it out.

Or you can try it from the browser on my Replit: https://replit.com/@xbromsson/planets?v=1 (it runs a little slow)
